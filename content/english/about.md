      **“Capten" is derived from the Welsh word for “Captain," symbolizing leadership, integrity, and the commitment to doing things the right way. The name reflects our philosophy of making complex engineering processes, like Dev, Sec, Ops, and Platform Engineering, easier and safer for our users, even as the industry evolves and grows more challenging. Also, the name resembles our goal of being the pioneer in the Service as a Software (SaaS 2.0) category, which we started nine years ago."**
