Evans CLI is a command-line tool designed to facilitate interaction with Go gRPC services. It offers a range of features that simplify the testing and debugging of gRPC services. Here are some of the advantages of using Evans CLI:

### Advantages of Evans CLI
Evans CLI stands out from other tools for interacting with gRPC services due to the following advantages:

- **Ease of use:** Evans CLI provides a simple command-line interface, making it incredibly user-friendly. It allows you to effortlessly send requests and receive responses from gRPC services.

- **Powerful features:** Evans CLI boasts several powerful features that streamline the testing and debugging process. These features include automatic service discovery, an interactive mode, and code generation capabilities.

- **Open source:** Evans CLI is an open-source tool, which means it is free to use and modify. This makes it a flexible and cost-effective choice for developers.

### Installation of Evans CLI
To install Evans CLI, follow these steps:

- **Prerequisites:**
    - Ensure that the following dependencies are installed:
        1. [protobuf-compiler](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/)
        2. [libprotobuf-dev](https://howtoinstall.co/en/libprotobuf-dev)

- Install Evans CLI by referring to the official documentation: [https://github.com/ktr0731/evans#installation](https://github.com/ktr0731/evans#installation). The documentation provides detailed instructions on how to download and install Evans CLI.

### Sample gRPC Server Project
For the purpose of demonstrating the usage of Evans CLI, let's consider a sample gRPC server that implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations based on an office protocol file.

You can find the source code for this [sample project here](https://github.com/intelops/evans-cli-grpc-in-go).

### How Evans CLI Solves Client-Side Issues for the gRPC Server
Evans CLI addresses client-side issues for the gRPC server through its REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) mode and CLI (Command Line Interface) mode. In this example, we will focus on the REPL mode, as it offers a more user-friendly way to interact with the server.

To start the Evans CLI client in REPL mode, execute the following command in the root directory of your project:

```bash
evans -r repl -p <your-gRPC-server-port>
```

Here are some useful commands you can utilize with Evans CLI:

- To view the available packages on your server, use the command:

```bash
show package
```

![View Packages](./images/see-packages.gif)

- To select a specific package from the available options, use the command:

```bash
package <Package_Name>
```

For example:
```bash
package gen
```

![Select Package](./images/select-package.gif)

- To view the services within the selected package, use the command:

```bash
show service
```

![View Services](./images/see-services.gif)

- To select a specific service from the available options, use the command:

```bash
service <Service_Name>
```

For example:
```bash
service OfficeService
```

![Select Service](./images/select-service.gif)

- To view the messages within the services.package, use the command:

```bash
show message
```

![View Messages](./images/see-messages.gif)

- To obtain more information about a particular message and its fields, use the command:

```bash
desc <Message_Name>
```

For example:
```bash
desc Office
```

![Message Description](./images/desc-msg.gif)

- To view the RPC methods

 available in the services, use the command:

```bash
show rpc
```

![View RPC Methods](./images/see-rpc.gif)

- To call a method from a service, use the command:

```bash
call <rpc-method-name>
```

For example:
```bash
call CreateOffice
```
