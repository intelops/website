In its [OSSRA 2023](https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity/resources/analyst-reports/open-source-security-risk-analysis.html?intcmp=sig-blog-ossra23) report, Synopsis highlighted that **96% of the scanned codebases contained open source**. Open source is so pervasive in commercial codebases that code owners may not even be aware of the open-source components present in their own software. With heavy reliance on open source (rightly so!), unless you know what's in your software supply chain, it's difficult to ensure its security.

A **software supply chain** is comprised of the codes, people, systems, and processes involved in creating, distributing, and maintaining software. In short, anything that touches it at any point. Exposed to weak links across the SDLC, a vulnerability at any stage or in any of the dependencies can make you susceptible to a potential compromise. With a surge in software supply chain attacks, organizations must strive to understand their software supply chain end-to-end, gain visibility into dependencies, and establish transparent distribution processes.

**Software supply chain security**, therefore, refers to the set of practices and measures that an organization must implement to safeguard their software supply chain from potential threats and vulnerabilities. These measures can include conducting code reviews, managing dependencies, verifying software authenticity, and continuous monitoring.

## Challenges in Software Supply Chain Security

1. **Lack of Visibility**: Inadequate understanding of the background and security posture of their software components raises risks for organizations, resulting in potential security flaws during development/deployment, compliance issues, slow threat responses, and high remediation costs.

2. **Insider Threats**: Malicious or unintentional actions by internal staff can lead to weaker security, data breaches, damaged trust, operational interruptions, and higher remediation costs. Such risks include vulnerabilities, unauthorized access, tainted code, and the disclosure of private information.

3. **Lack of Collaboration**: The lack of industry collaboration hinders information exchange, new risk detection, and efficient security solution implementation. Inconsistent security standards result in varying security measures, leading to longer response times to new threats and providing attackers with more time to exploit weaknesses.

4. **Third Party Platforms**: Using third-party platforms requires establishing trust through thorough verification. Failing to do so can result in heightened vulnerability to security breaches or compromises. Dependency on external vendors also introduces the risk of disruptions or support discontinuation, which can significantly impact the security and stability of the software supply chain.

5. **Lack of Standardized Practices**: The absence of standardized practices leads to inconsistent security measures, creating weak links in the software supply chain. Organizations face compliance and legal difficulties while struggling to adhere to security-related rules and licensing duties. Effective risk analysis becomes challenging, making it difficult to assess the overall security posture of the software supply chain.

## Addressing Software Supply Chain Security Issues With Compage

To help mitigate the challenges associated with software supply chain security, one notable solution is [Compage](https://intelops.ai/compage/), a platform that allows organizations to enforce software supply chain security. Compage offers a set of additional features to automate essential security processes, such as code signing, vulnerability analysis, and integrity verification, ensuring the trustworthiness of software throughout its lifecycle and beyond.

Compage enhances software supply chain security in a number of ways, including:

- Build & Source code preparation
- Generate Configurations
- Generate Vulnerability reports
- Generate SBOM

## Build & Source code preparation: 
Compage specializes in automating the important build and source code preparation process for software supply chain security. By streamlining and improving the build stage, Compage empowers organizations to establish a solid foundation for the security and integrity of their software supply chain.
  - Eliminates manual errors and ensures consistent, reliable builds.
  - Enforces code hygiene and quality assurance practices, including static code analysis (SCA) and code reviews to identify vulnerabilities and coding errors.
  - Facilitates vulnerability scanning of the source code and its dependencies for proactive risk management.
  - Promotes secure coding standards and provides a centralized repository for managing build artifacts.

## Generate Configurations
Generating configuration is an important, if not the most important, aspect of software supply chain security, and Compage provides powerful features for simplifying and automating this process. Configurations include security settings, access controls, network configurations, and other parameters aligned with industry best practices and compliance requirements.

 With Compage, organizations can easily define and enforce predefined security configurations and policies, thereby minimizing the risk of misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. The automation provided by Compage ensures consistency across deployments and eliminates manual errors that might occur during the configuration setup.
 
 Verifying, validating, and controlling the integrity of source and container images becomes seamless with Compage's assistance. This ensures the utmost security and integrity of the software during deployment.

## Generate Vulnerability Reports
Compage provides accurate vulnerability reports that enable businesses to proactively address potential security holes in their software supply chain. The framework analyzes software components and their dependencies to perform vulnerability assessments. It checks for known gaps, flaws, and misconfigurations, and provides organizations with comprehensive reports that outline potential security threats.

Compageâ€™s vulnerability reports not only highlight the identified vulnerabilities, but also provide guidance on remediation. This helps organizations understand the necessary steps to secure their software and make informed decisions to mitigate risks.

By automating the process of generating vulnerability reports, Compage saves organizations valuable time and resources. It enables continuous monitoring of the software supply chain, ensuring that any newly discovered vulnerabilities can be promptly addressed and remediated.

## Generate SBOMs
Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) provides a detailed inventory of software components used in a project which can be used to gain insights into potential security risks associated with the software's dependencies. These include vulnerabilities, outdated versions, and licenses that may pose security or compliance concerns. By helping organizations generate SBOMs, Compage enhances visibility and transparency in their software supply chain.

Compage automates the process of generating SBOMs by analyzing the software's composition, including its dependencies, versions, licenses, and other relevant information. The generated SBOM serves as a comprehensive record that helps organizations track and manage software components effectively.

Automating the generation of SBOMs simplifies the process of tracking software components, reducing manual efforts, and ensuring accuracy. This provides a foundation for conducting risk assessments, prioritizing remediation efforts, and making informed decisions regarding software component selection and integration.
