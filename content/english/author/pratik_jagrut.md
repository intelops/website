👋 Hey there!

I'm a community-driven software engineer, and I absolutely love diving into the world of cloud-native development and exploring the endless possibilities of open-source technologies. 💻

My skill set revolves around Kubernetes, GoLang, Python, Docker, and other fascinating container technologies. 🚀 And hey, just to add to the mix, I'm also CKA certified! 🎓

But you know what? My journey doesn't stop at coding. I have a genuine passion for technical evangelism. 🎤 I've had the privilege to speak at world-renowned events, sharing my knowledge and insights with others. It's such an exhilarating experience! And when I'm not on stage, you can find me pouring my thoughts into engaging technical blogs at [psj.codes](https://psj.codes). 📝

If you've made it this far and you're intrigued by what you've read, let's not leave it at that! Reach out, and let's connect. Who knows what exciting opportunities may be awaiting us? 😊
