IntelOps UI is a library with React UI components to design SASS websites.

### Introduction 

IntelOps UI is an open-source React component library that is used to implement IntelOps [Website Design](https://alpha.optimizor.app). It includes a collection of prebuilt components ready to use in production directly. All components are customizable and easy to implement your own custom designs for your websites.

#### Why IntelOps UI?

- **Customizability:** the library has a lot of customizable features. The components clearly show all the ways that you can customize your components.
- **Open-Source:** Many open-source contributors worked together to create these components so that companies can focus on the buisness logic instead of working on their UI from scratch.
