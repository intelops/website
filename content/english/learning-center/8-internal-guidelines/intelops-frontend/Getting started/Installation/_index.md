Install IntelOps UI for your design needs. 

> **Note:** You can see the template in [Intelops UI private repo](https://github.com/intelops/ui-templates-common-repo)

### Package Prerequisites

> **Note:** Since this is a private repo, just installing using npm won't download the packages, we need to follow a few more steps - adding GitHub PATs to your VScode.

[How to add GitHub Personal Access Tokens to your VsCode](https://intelops.ai/learning-center/8-internal-guidelines/package-mangement-in-git-platform/)

To install the published UI packages into your code:
1. Create a `.npmrc` file inside the root directory of the [Intelops UI private repo](https://github.com/intelops/ui-templates-common-repo)
2. Add the below two lines in the npmrc file
    - **registry**=https://npm.pkg.github.com
    - **auth_token**={Personal access token generated using intelops private github account}
3. Now add the below line in `package.json` file under dependencies
    - "@intelops/intelops_ui": "1.0.3"

### Dependencies
```js
"Dependencies":{
"@intelops/intelops_ui": "1.0.3"
}
```
After adding the `.npmrc file` before installation run :
```bash
npm login
```
This will ask for your :
- Username: {github username}
- Password: {personal access token that you've added in your .npmrc file}

Now you ready to start your installation.

### Installation
Now to install the package, run one of the following commands in your project:

**npm**
```bash
npm install @intelops/intelops_ui@1.0.3
```
**yarn**
```bash
yarn add @intelops/intelops_ui@latest --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```
After installation make sure to check if the latest version of the common ui package has been installed under node_modules folder.
