#### Let's  an example of what that library might look like

- Define the library namespace
```javascript
local mydashboard = {};
```
- Define a function for creating a new dashboard
```javascript 
mydashboard.dashboard = (title, panels) => {
  {
    title: title,
    panels: panels,
  }
};
```
- Define a function for creating a new row
```javascript
mydashboard.row = (panels) => {
  {
    panels: panels,
  }
};
```
- Define a function for creating a new panel
```javascript
mydashboard.panel = (title, datasource, charttype, xaxis, yaxis) => {
  {
    title: title,
    datasource: datasource,
    charttype: charttype,
    xaxis: xaxis,
    yaxis: yaxis,
  }
};
```
- Define some example data sources
```javascript
local datasources = {
  data1: "http://myapp/data1",
  data2: "http://myapp/data2",
};
```
- Define an example dashboard using the library functions
```javascript
local mydashboardconfig = mydashboard.dashboard("My Dashboard", [
  mydashboard.row([
    mydashboard.panel("Panel 1", datasources.data1, "bar", "x", "y"),
    mydashboard.panel("Panel 2", datasources.data2, "line", "x", "y"),
  ]),
]);
```

- Print the resulting JSON configuration
```javascript
std.manifestJsonnet(mydashboardconfig)
```
**In this example, we define a mydashboard library namespace that contains functions for creating a dashboard, row, and panel. We also define an example set of data sources and use the library functions to create a dashboard configuration with two panels, one displaying a bar chart and the other displaying a line chart.**

> ***To use this library in your application, you can load the library into your Jsonnet code and call the library functions to generate the appropriate JSON configuration for your dashboard. You can also extend the library with additional functions and objects to support more advanced dashboard features, such as custom styling, event handlers, and user interactions.***
