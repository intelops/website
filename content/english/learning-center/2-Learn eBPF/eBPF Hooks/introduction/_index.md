In the context of eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter), an eBPF hook refers to a specific point in the kernel or a user-space program where an eBPF program can be attached to. These hooks allow eBPF programs to execute custom code and modify the behavior of the kernel or user-space programs at specific events, such as system calls, network packets, or other kernel events. Hooks are the mechanism through which eBPF programs interact with the kernel and other programs, making them a fundamental part of eBPF's power and flexibility.
