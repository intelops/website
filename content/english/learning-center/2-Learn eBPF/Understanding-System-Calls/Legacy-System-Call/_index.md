### Introduction:
The Linux operating system operates as a bridge between user-space applications and the computer hardware, employing a variety of system calls to perform this intricate task. One such ancient yet noteworthy method is using the `int $0x80` instruction. This blog explores the operational details, procedures, and the historical context of `int $0x80`, providing an in-depth analysis of its role, working mechanism, and the associated challenges.

### Legacy System Call Method: int $0x80:
In the historical context of Linux on x86 platforms, system calls were implemented using software interrupts, primarily `int $0x80`. The user process desiring to execute a system call would:
1. Copy the desired system call number to `%eax`.
2. Copy parameters, if present, into registers as per ABI.
3. Execute `int $0x80`.
4. Read the return value from `%eax`.

Executing `int $0x80` would generate interrupt `0x80`, invoking an interrupt service routine.

### Kernel Space Operations at int $0x80:
Within the kernel space, when `int $0x80` is executed, the `x86` trap associated with `0x80` is registered in the `idt_setup_traps()` function, located in `arch/x86/kernel/idt.c`.

```c
#define IA32_SYSCALL_VECTOR 0x80 // Represents 128 in hexadecimal form
// ...
// The function entry_INT80_32 is associated with IA32_SYSCALL_VECTOR.
```

#### Inside entry_INT80_32:
In this function, the arguments are stored in the registers, and their values are stored on the stack. The function `do_int80_syscall_32` is then called, and subsequently, the registers are restored. 

```c
void do_int80_syscall_32(struct pt_regs *regs)
{
        enter_from_user_mode();
        local_irq_enable();
        do_syscall_32_irqs_on(regs);
}
```

Here, the interrupt is activated, and another function is called, which retrieves a function from the syscall table and calls it with syscall arguments.

```c
regs->ax = ia32_sys_call_table[nr](
                        (unsigned int)regs->bx, (unsigned int)regs->cx,
                        (unsigned int)regs->dx, (unsigned int)regs->si,
                        (unsigned int)regs->di, (unsigned int)regs->bp);
```

### The Downside of int $0x80:
The primary limitation of using `int $0x80` lies in its nature of being a software interrupt, inherently making it slower. This latency in execution becomes a significant bottleneck, especially considering the speed and efficiency required in modern computing environments.

### Conclusion:
The `int $0x80` instruction serves as a monumental piece of Linux's historical architecture, allowing us to understand the evolution of system calls in Linux. While its usage has dwindled due to its inherent slowness, studying its operational mechanics provides a window into the foundational aspects of system call implementations in Linux, aiding in the appreciation of the modern, more efficient mechanisms in place today.
