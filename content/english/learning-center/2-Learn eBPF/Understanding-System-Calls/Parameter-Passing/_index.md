### Introduction:
In Linux, system calls act as crucial interfaces, allowing user-space applications to request services from the kernel. Unlike ordinary functions, system calls straddle user land and kernel land, necessitating a distinct mechanism for passing parameters. This blog unfolds the intricate process of passing parameters in system calls, emphasizing the role of CPU registers in this unique interchange between user mode and kernel mode and exploring the Application Binary Interface (ABI) conventions across different architectures.

### The Mechanics of Passing Parameters:
System calls, akin to ordinary functions, often necessitate input/output parameters to facilitate various operations. In standard C functions, parameters are typically passed by placing their values in the active program stack. However, since system calls traverse from user land to kernel land, utilizing either the user mode or kernel mode stack directly is not viable.

Instead, system call parameters are meticulously written in the CPU registers before the execution of the system call. Following this, the kernel copies these parameters from the CPU registers onto the kernel mode stack. Subsequently, the system call service routine is invoked, ensuring that the parameters are securely and accurately passed from user space to kernel space.

### ABI Convention and Architectural Differences:
The mechanism of parameter passing and the utilization of CPU registers adhere to the ABI convention, with variations depending on the system architecture.

#### On x86 Architecture:
- The `%eax` register holds the system call number.
- The registers `%ebx`, `%ecx`, `%edx`, `%esi`, `%edi`, and `%ebp` contain up to six arbitrary arguments.
- The instruction to initiate the mode switch is `int $0x80`.
- The return value is stored in the `%eax` register.

#### On x86_64 Architecture:
- The `rax` register encompasses the system call number.
- The registers `rdi`, `rsi`, `rdx`, `rcx`, `r8`, and `r9` are utilized to hold arguments.
- The `syscall` instruction is employed to activate the system call.
- The return value is secured in the `rax` register.

### Understanding the Significance:
The unique method of parameter passing in system calls is quintessential to maintaining the security and stability of Linux systems. By utilizing CPU registers and adhering to ABI conventions, Linux ensures a seamless and secure transition of parameters between user land and kernel land, enabling precise interactions and executions of system calls across different architectures.

### Conclusion:
Delving into the nuances of parameter passing in system calls provides insights into the meticulous methodologies employed by Linux to ensure secure and accurate interactions between user-space applications and the kernel. Understanding the distinctive role of CPU registers and the variations in ABI conventions across architectures highlights the multifaceted nature of Linux, enriching our comprehension of this powerful operating system's internal mechanics.
