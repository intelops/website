### Introduction:
Introduced in the PentiumÂ® II processor, the `SYSENTER` and `SYSEXIT` instructions are pivotal components of the Fast System Call facility in Linux, particularly for 32-bit systems. These instructions, optimized for transitions between different protection rings, significantly enhance the performance and efficiency of system calls. This article delves into the technical details of `SYSENTER` and `SYSEXIT`, their coordination between user programs and the kernel, and the crucial differences from the legacy interrupt method.

### SYSENTER/SYSEXIT Overview:
- **SYSENTER:**
  - **Functionality:** Facilitates optimized transitions to protection ring 0 (CPL = 0).
  - **Use:** It's a part of the Fast System Call mechanism, serving as a replacement for traditional software interrupts.
  
- **SYSEXIT:**
  - **Functionality:** Optimizes transitions back to protection ring 3 (CPL = 3) from protection ring 0.
  - **Role:** Complements `SYSENTER` by ensuring efficient return to user mode after the system call execution.

### Coordination and Specification:
Executing a system call using `SYSENTER` is more intricate compared to the conventional interrupt method. It necessitates meticulous coordination between user programs (via glibc) and the kernel. Before the execution of the `SYSENTER` instruction, specific parameters including the privilege level 0 code segment, code entry point, and the stack segment and stack pointer need to be defined to the following MSRs:
- **IA32_SYSENTER_CS (MSR address 174H):** Holds the privilege level 0 code segment.
- **IA32_SYSENTER_EIP (MSR address 176H):** Holds the address of the function to execute upon `SYSENTER` instruction execution by a user program.
- **IA32_SYSENTER_ESP (MSR address 175H):** Holds the stack pointer for privilege level 0.

### Implementation:
The function `enable_sep_cpu()` in `arch/x86/kernel/cpu/common.c` is instrumental in setting up the aforementioned MSRs, thereby facilitating the functioning of `SYSENTER` and `SYSEXIT`.

Here is a snippet from the `enable_sep_cpu()` function:
```c
void enable_sep_cpu(void)
{
        if (!boot_cpu_has(X86_FEATURE_SEP))
                return;
        
        int cpu = get_cpu();
        struct tss_struct *tss = &per_cpu(cpu_tss_rw, cpu);

        tss->x86_tss.ss1 = __KERNEL_CS;
        wrmsr(MSR_IA32_SYSENTER_CS, tss->x86_tss.ss1, 0);
        wrmsr(MSR_IA32_SYSENTER_ESP, (unsigned long)(cpu_entry_stack(cpu) + 1), 0);
        wrmsr(MSR_IA32_SYSENTER_EIP, (unsigned long)entry_SYSENTER_32, 0);
        put_cpu();
}
```
This function, by configuring the MSRs, sets the stage for the user program to execute system calls using `SYSENTER` and return using `SYSEXIT`.

### Conclusion:
The advent of `SYSENTER` and `SYSEXIT` in 32-bit Linux systems marked a transition from the traditional, interrupt-based approach to a more sophisticated and efficient methodology. The intricate coordination and detailed specification involved in these instructions underscore the commitment of Linux to optimize system call execution and transitions between protection rings. By understanding the mechanics of `SYSENTER` and `SYSEXIT`, one gains insight into the innovative endeavors that power the efficiency and performance of Linux systems.
