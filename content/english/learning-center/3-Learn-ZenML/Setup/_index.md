### How to make your system ZenML Ready
ZenML comes as a Python library so it is necessary to have a ***python>=3.7,<= 3.10*** installed on your local machine.  
Virtual environments let's you have a stable, reproducible, and portable environment. You are in control of which package versions are installed and when they are upgraded.  
I use Anaconda to create and manage my Python envionments but you can also use ```pyenv-virtualenv``` or ```python -m venv```.

1. Let's create a new environment called *zenml_playground*.
	```cmd
	conda create --name zenml_playground python=3.8
	``` 

2. Activate the virtual environment.
	```cmd
	conda activate zenml_playground
	```
3. Install ZenML inside the virtual environment.
	```cmd
	pip install zenml
	```
4. [Optional] In order to get access to the ZenML dashboard locally you need to launch ZenML Server and Dashboard locally. For this, you need to install ZenML Server separately.
	```cmd
	pip install "zenml[server]"
	```
5. To verify if the installation is completed start Python interpreter and try to import zenml.
	```python
	import zenml
	print(zenml.__version__)
	```  
	If you see a ZenML version displayed on your command prompt then you are all set to explore ZenML Steps and Pipelines.
