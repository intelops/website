description: "Temporal acts like a reliable manager for your application. It breaks down your code into manageable steps called workflows. If any part of the workflow encounters an issue, like a network outage, Temporal automatically retries it until it succeeds. This ensures your application keeps running smoothly, even in case of unexpected problems."
