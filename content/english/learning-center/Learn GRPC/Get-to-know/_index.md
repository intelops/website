##### what is grpc?

gRPC is an open-source high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework developed by Google. It is designed to enable efficient communication between microservices, as well as client-server applications, and supports multiple programming languages, including Go, Java, Python, and more.
gRPC uses Protocol Buffers (protobuf) as its default data serialization format. Protobuf is a language- and platform-neutral binary format that is smaller, faster, and more efficient than traditional text-based formats such as JSON and XML.

##### Features of gRPC:

- Fast and efficient:gRPC uses Protocol Buffers (protobuf) as its default data serialization format, which is smaller, faster, and more efficient than traditional text-based formats such as JSON and XML. gRPC also uses HTTP/2, which enables bi-directional streaming and reduces latency and overhead.
- Multi-language support:gRPC supports multiple programming languages, including Go, Java, Python, C++, Ruby, and more. This makes it easy for teams to use their language of choice while still communicating with services written in other languages.
- Service definitions:gRPC uses a simple and intuitive interface definition language (IDL) to define the API of a service. This IDL is used to generate client and server code, reducing the amount of boilerplate code that developers need to write.
- Strong typing:gRPC uses strong typing to ensure that the client and server agree on the types and structure of the data being exchanged. This helps prevent errors and makes it easier to maintain and evolve services over time.
- Interceptors:gRPC provides interceptors that allow developers to add common functionality, such as authentication and logging, to their services without modifying the service code.
- Load balancing:gRPC includes built-in support for load balancing, allowing for the automatic distribution of client requests across multiple servers.
