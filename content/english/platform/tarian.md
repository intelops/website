      Traditional security tools don't cut! 

      * Sophisticated threats are evolving at Gen-AI pace.
      * External and internal threat actors are added disadvantage.
      * Chaos of tools and platform to deal with risk management. 
      * No proper unified and standardized solutions.
      * Lack of automation.
      * Too long to fix, update or remediate, and even recover.
