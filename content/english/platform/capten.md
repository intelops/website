      * **Toolchain Fatigue**: Disparate DevOps tools lead to fragmented development process and lack of visibility into the overall state of software.
      * **No Self-Service**: Lack of self-service capabilities increases reliance on manual interventions, prolonging development cycles and impacting organizational profitability and sustainability.
      * **Deprioritizing Security**: Treating security as an afterthought exposes software to security breaches and increase the risk of non-compliance with industry regulations and data protection laws.
      * **Pressure to Ship**: Sacrificing security for speed leaves software vulnerable, compounded by imbalanced team sizes between development and security.
      * **Proprietary Frameworks**: Tools with vendor lock-ins and proprietary frameworks make scalability and adapting to changing business needs a huge challenge.
