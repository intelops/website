      * **Complex Architecture**: Troubleshooting microservice architecture is challenging due to complex flows, making it nearly impossible to create tests for proper system operation.
      * **Poor Quality Software Delivery**: Negating rigorous testing and validation heightens the risk of deploying software with hidden bugs and performance issues, impacting user experience and overall quality.
      * **Integration Gaps**: Lack of seamless integration with CICD workflows disconnects testing from the development process, hindering automation, continuous testing, and timely feedback.
      * **Manual Testing**: Manual testing is tedious and slow and imposes a cognitive burden on developers, hindering code quality and efficiency.
      * **Collaboration Constraints**: Collaboration challenges hinder effective testing, making it difficult to manage and track changes to test scripts, thereby hampering coordination.

      openTelemetry's Trace-Based testing for modern applications enhances test coverage and enables QA, Dev and Ops teams to gain insights for a holistic understanding of application behavior, resulting in faster iterations and delivery with context.

      * **Fast Test Setup**: Utilize your existing observability data to build tests in minutes using assertions. It's that simple!
      * **Seamless CICD Integration**: Automate tests with smooth integration with CI/CD pipelines for consistent and reliable testing. 
      * **Enhanced Software Quality**: Leverage result validation capabilities to conduct thorough analysis for effective issue identification and decision-making.
      * **Environment-Agnostic**: Minimize mocking through targeted tests across different environments.
      * **Improved Collaboration**: Collaborate effectively with Git integration, streamlining version control, test script sharing, and change tracking.
