What is DevOps?
This article was originally posted on: http://intelops.ai/blog
DevOps, literally, is the intersection of development and operations. It is an extremely broad term, used differently by different industries. The best definition for it is that its a combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools to release software fast and with high quality. This is accomplished by combining development, testing, security, and operations into a continuous and streamlined development/deployment process.

Why Use DevOps?
In order to recognize the benefits that DevOps brings to organizations, we must understand what DevOps is. The simplest way to understand DevOps is to consider it in the aspect of application development. Each time an application is created or updated, it follows a development process which ends with the app being deployed to the cloud or servers. The application is deployed in order to ensure delivery to its end-users.
The application development process includes:
1. Idea
2. Requirements
3. Coding/Testing
4. Building/Packaging
5. Deploying
6. Operations & Monitoring
Each time an update happens to the application (i.e. a feature is added), you will need to run through the entire process. This would be fine, however, the process is riddled with hindrances which delay the release/deployment of new features. DevOps aims to improve on this process by making it faster, and delivering the same new features with minimal bugs.

Hindrances in the Current Development Process
The way the current process is set up, development and deployment (a.k.a. operations) are handled by two separate teams. This leads to obstacles which inhibit the process’s ability to implement new features, and introduces release delays. Some of which I have outlined below:
* Conflict of interests
- Since development and operations are split into separate teams, this presents a conflict of interest between the two. The developers want to release as many new features as possible. The operations team wants to maintain the stability of their system. When new features are introduced, the stability of the system is risked, creating a conflict of interest. Ultimately, this will present itself as a release delay.
* Lack of collaboration
- With two separate teams, a lack of communication arises. Bad documentation or too many bugs can cause the operations team to send the application back to the developers. This back-and-forth ‘handover’ process adds slowdowns to the workflow. This can delay releases from days to months.
* Manual work
- Most of the release process contains manual work. Everything from deploying the app to configuring user access is done manually. Even if we consider creating scripts to automate parts of the process, those scripts would have to be run manually.
- Inter-peer and inter-team knowledge sharing becomes extremely cumbersome when doing manual work. This is because each person would have to update the other party on everything they have changed.
- Any changes in the server infrastructure can introduce massive delays and headaches in manual work.
* Security
- After development, a separate security team would check for vulnerabilities. This is also manual work, which, again, introduces delays in our application process (You might have heard of another intersectional term, DevSecOps, which incorporates the security aspect).
* Testing
- Most of the application tests are automated, however, given new features, certain aspects of the application need to be tested manually. This adds to the manual work and release delays.

By removing one hindrance at a time, DevOps aims to combine all of these different areas (development, testing, security, and operations). This creates an automated and streamlined development/deployment process. Given that the definition of this term is so broad, companies who have adopted this philosophy have catered it to their own needs.
